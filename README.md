# Roadside Radar Segmentation

This repository accompanies the paper:

**"Deep Segmentation of 3+1D Radar Point Cloud for Real-Time Roadside Traffic User Detection"**  

---

## The RoadsideRadar Dataset
We will release the **RoadsideRadar Dataset**, containing:
- 5399 Annotated radar pcd frames with **point-wise labels** for various road users.
- snychronized camera frames for visualization purposes.
- Train / Validation / Test splits as used in the manuscript.

The dataset is currently being anonymized for GDPR compliance. It will be made available once anonymization is completed.  

---

## Code
This repository will provide:
- Preprocessing scripts for radar pcds,
- Training and evaluation pipelines,
- Implementation of the proposed segmentation models.

The code is currently being cleaned and documented for public release.
